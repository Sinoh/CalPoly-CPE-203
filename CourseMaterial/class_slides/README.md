# Class Slides - Disclaimer

This directory holds something close to the class slides.  These slides
are subject to change.  Indeed, slides that haven't been presented in
class yet might just be from a previous quarter.They shouldn't be considered
to be anything more than a rough draft.

I *strongly* advise against using these slides as a substitute for class
notes.  Indeed, these slides aren't really meant to be read off-line -- they're
meant to support the lecture.  I intentionally don't write too much, because
I want people to pay attention to the lecture, rather than reading the
slides.  Further, the act of writing out notes longhand is a great way to
organize ideas; it seems to force people to think about the material in a way
that aids retention.

With that said, there's some marginal value in making these slides available.
It's an easy way to provide an answer to the question "what did I see on that
slide yesterday?"  But really, that's about it.

A note about format:  I'll make an effort to publish a PDF version of the
slides, once I've presented them.  

Use at your own risk.
