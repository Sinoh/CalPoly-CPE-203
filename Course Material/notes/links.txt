	Download "Java SE 9.x".  8 or 10 are fine, if you have that already.
	"Java SE 9" means "Java Standard Edition, version 9," but it's often
	called "JDK 1.9" (Java Development Kit).

	The JDK 1.9 Platform API Specification.

    https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/
	The IntelliJ IDEA IDE.  They have a free student license that
	seems to be granted automatically to anyone with a .edu e-mail
	address.  If you prefer, you can just use the free Community version,
	too.
