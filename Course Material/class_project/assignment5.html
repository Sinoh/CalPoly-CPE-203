  </div>

<p>
During the refactoring pass of the previous assignment, you likely noticed
a fair amount of duplication, both in terms of instance variables and
methods, when breaking <code>Entity</code> into multiple separate classes.
For this assignment, you will eliminate this duplication by refactoring
the duplication into new <b>abstract classes</b>. The entity classes
will then inherit part of their implementation (consisting of instance
variables and methods), as 
appropriate, rather than duplicating that code in each subclass.
</p>

<ul>
   <li>Why do this?  Code is easier to maintain when there is less
      duplication.  A change only has to be made in one place, rather
      than in all duplicates.  It's also slightly more efficient.
   </li>
   <li>Why abstract classes?  A direct instances of these new classes
      would not be meaningful in the context of the program.  Declaring
      the class <code>abstract</code> prevents instantiation, but still
      allows for inheritance.  It also allows the class to have abstract
      methods, if appropriate.
   </li>
   <li>Why use inheritance?  Often, composition is preferred to inheritance
       (see, for example, 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance">composition to inheritance</a>.)
      However, that style has some drawbacks.  In our case, the different subclasses
      are intrinsically highly coupled, due to the nature of the problem being solved.
      In a case like this, using composition instead of inheritance would just add
      structural complexity with no meaningful increase in cohesion or decrease in
      coupling.  Preferring composition to inheritance is a valid design principle,
      but it should not be taken too far!
   </li>
</ul>

<h2>Task Overview</h2>
</div>

<p>
We will focus on "entities." These are all classes implementing the concept of an
<code>Entity</code> from the original, provided implementation.  With a focus
on entities, examine the set of classes you have from the previous assignment
to identify duplication.  Refactor the duplicate code
(fields and methods) into a hierarchy including of abstract classes, where
appropriate.  The goal (and, to be both explicit, <em>the requirement for this
assignment</em>) is to eliminate all such duplication.  This may seem
excessive, but it is often illustrative to apply a principle to the extreme
to see if it continues to provide benefits, and to get a sense for when it
might fall short.
</p>

<p>
Completion of this assignment will consist of
</p>
<ul>
   <li>updated UML document (named <code>Inheritance.graphml</code>)</li>
   <li>refactored code base</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="header">
Duplicate Fields (Instance Variables)
</h4>
<p>
Such duplication is most obvious for instance variables.  You may be
able to identify duplication directly from the names and (matching or
closely related) types.  There are, however, times when two classes use different
names for conceptually identical fields.
</p>

<h4 class="header">
Instance Methods
</h4>

<p>
Identifying duplicate instance methods will require careful examination of the
code within the potentially duplicate methods.  As a start, the names and
parameters must generally match, but the method implementation must be considered
as well.  You will find that the initial set of
methods to consider are those specified by the interfaces introduced in
the previous assignment.
</p>

<p>
Your refactoring should not abuse inheritance with regard to methods.
In particular, assume you have identified method <code>foo</code> as
common among three classes (<code>A</code>, <code>B</code>,
and <code>C</code>), but only two of them (<code>B</code> and <code>C</code>)
have the same implementation.  You should not promote one implementation
of <code>foo</code> (e.g., from <code>B</code> and <code>C</code>) to the
new parent class only to then redefine it in some subclasses (e.g., in
<code>A</code>).  Instead, you can, for example, define an abstract class (named
<code>Abby</code> for this example) with an abstract method
<code>foo</code>. <code>A</code> can extend <code>Abby</code> and define
its implementation of <code>foo</code>.  Another new abstract
class can also extend <code>Abby</code> to define the single implementation
of <code>foo</code> used by <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> (which then
extend this new class).
</p>

<h4 class="header">
Take Care -- No Incidental Additions, Access Violations
</h4>

<p>
At no point should a class inherit instance variables or methods due to
this refactoring that it did not already possess prior to the refactoring.
If such happens, then your refactoring either lifted something too high
in the class hierarchy or it needs an additional intermediate class.
</p>

<p>
As before, all data should remain <code>private</code>.  If a subclass
needs to access/change this data, then it can do so via accessor or mutator
methods.  If such methods do not exist, then you can add them (as
<code>protected</code> methods) to the abstract class.
</p>

<h4 class="header">
UML
</h4>

<p>
You are strongly encouraged to begin this refactoring by updating your
UML document first, while looking at the code for method
implementations.  Doing so allows you to take advantage of the graphical aspects
of UML to immediately identify duplication and to quickly refactor by
injecting intermediate classes.  Experience with this project indicates
that the majority of duplication can be identified and refactored quickly
through this approach, which then gives you an initial plan for
the code modifications.  Focus on the most obvious duplications first.
</p><p>
As always, be sure to compile and test your program after each individual
refactoring!
</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>Source Code Refactoring</h2>
</div>

<p>
   Your refactoring should mirror the work that you do for your design
document (UML diagram).  Your refactoring must not add or remove any
program functionality.  The resulting program must work as before.
</p>

<div class="header">
<h3>Additional Tips on Refactoring Methods</h3>
</div>

<p>
Some of the entity classes contain identical methods, beause they
were added in the previous assignment.  But
there are also some methods from the orginal given code that are less
obvious duplicates.  In addition, there are some methods that are not
full duplicates, but that do contain significant amounts of code
duplication.
</p>

<p>
Consider the following tips for refactoring the less obvious duplications.
This should be done after refactoring (both in UML and in the code base)
the more obvious duplications so that there is less code to consider.
</p>

<ul>
   <li><p>For two methods that appear to be doing roughly the same thing, but
         that differ slightly in their implementation:  Examine the code
         to determine if the code can be rewritten to match.  This 
         requires careful consideration for what each method does (and does
         <em>not</em> do) to avoid introducing bugs.
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>Some methods may have the same general structure (and match
         identically in significant portions), but differ in some
         segments.  For such methods, the general structure and identical
         portions can be refactored into a parent class.  This parent class
         will declare new <code>protected abstract</code> method(s) that
         each subclass then implements to define the unique behavior.
      </p>
   </li>
</ul>

<div class="header">
<h2>Assignment Submission</h2>
</div>

<p>
Your submission must include
</p>
<ul>
   <li><code>Inheritance.graphml</code></li>
   <li>All source files, includling any that were unchanged.
Your grader should be able to build your project based
on the files submitted.  You do not need to submit the image files,
the image list, or the world save file.  Do not include any <code>.java</code> files
that are not part of your project!  The grading program might not know which
one to pick.
</ul>
<p>
To submit your assignment, copy the files to the new, blank repository created when 
you accept the github assignment at
