Hello,

If you are getting this file, it means that the lab 3 you submitted
did not compile with my test script. There may be several reasons, but 
what I've found most common are the following:

	1. Using List instead of an array for the points in ConvexPolygon
	2. Misspelled classes such as WorkSpace.java versus Workspace.java
	3. Misspelled methods such as getConvexPolygons() versus getConvexPolygon()
	4. Code you submitted that just won't compile

These are just some of the common errors and there could be other errors as to 
why your code failed to run with my testsuite. If you could fix up your code and 
then resubmit to github that'd be great. Please be sure to look at the specification 
carefully.

If you have any questions as to why your code doesn't compile or if you believe 
it to be correct don't hesitate to come talk to me. Another email has been sent 
out regarding to my availability. If none of these hours work please just email 
me and we can try to work something out.

Have a great day,
Your TA
